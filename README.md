# Image-Classification

In this project, We will working with a dataset on flowers, containing five types: Lilly, Orchid, Tulip, 
Lotus, and Sunflower. Image classification is the process of teaching machines to understand 
visual information. 

Our goal is to build a model that accurately identifies flowers from their images into one of these 
five categories. We aim to compare and analyze different neural networks to determine which 
performs best and why. 

To understand the data, we first checked for any corrupted images and then split them into 
training, testing, and validation sets. We examined the distribution of images in each category 
within the training set to get a sense of how they're divided. For image classification, we'll employ 
three models: Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), 
and transfer learning.
